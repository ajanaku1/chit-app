/**
 * Chit Bot on mainnet: the same buttons, no key held (docs/bot-mainnet-mode.md).
 *
 * The owner keeps their wallet, creates a session account of their own on
 * the Sessions page, grants the bot's key a bounded session (which router,
 * how much a trade, how much in all, until when) and links the account to
 * their Telegram with one signature. From then on Buy is one `execute` on
 * their account, signed by the bot's key; the account pays the trade, the
 * bot pays the gas. Pause or revoke is the owner's, in one transaction.
 *
 * Sell is one call too, once the owner has turned "let it sell" on for the
 * bot's key (`setSellAllowed` on the account, from the Sessions page): the
 * bot's key calls `sell(router, poolKey, amountIn, minOut, deadline)` on the
 * account and the account writes the router calldata itself, so the ETH
 * lands in the account and nowhere else. The two Permit2 approvals a swap
 * needs are made inside that call, for the sale's amount and this block,
 * and cleared before it returns: nothing is approved before a sale, nothing
 * stays approved after one, no other key inherits anything, and turning the
 * flag off is complete. The sale counts as a call of the session (same
 * expiry, pause and revoke, the router has to be a rule target) and spends
 * none of the ETH caps; the amount is bounded by what the account holds.
 * What the flag does not bound is the price: the pool and the floor are the
 * key's, so the owner is trusting the key with the position, not only the
 * caps, and the Sessions page says so where the flag is set. `withdraw`
 * stays the owner's alone.
 *
 * Each webhook request makes at most one send on the tapping user's own
 * account and waits for at most one receipt, inside the host's budget for
 * the function (api/bot.js is stopped at sixty seconds). The one thing that
 * sends more in a request is a leader's landed buy, which is mirrored into
 * the followers' accounts before the reply is done: those sends are given
 * only what is left of the request's budget after the leader's own receipt
 * (MIRRORS_UNTIL_MS from the request's start), each waits for its receipt
 * only that long, and none is started once it is spent, so the log, the
 * feed and the followers' lines are written before the host's cut-off
 * rather than lost to it. Every update is claimed by id before it is acted
 * on, so a request the host killed mid-trade is not acted on again when
 * Telegram redelivers it.
 *
 * What this handler never does: hold a key of the owner's, withdraw, or
 * trade from an account that was not linked with the owner's signature.
